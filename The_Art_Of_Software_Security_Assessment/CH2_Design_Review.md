# Chapter 2 - DESIGN REVIEW
## Introduction
Developers like design reviews because they maps closely to formal software development methodologies. Code auditors think it just gets in the way of the real work. The process has value for both.  
Design review is a tool for identifying architecture vulnerabilities and prioritising components for implementation review. It is part of the complete review process.
## Software Design Fundamentals
### Algorithms
Software engineeering can be thought of as the process of developing and implementing algorithms. It focuses on developing key program algorithms and data structures, and specifying problem domain logic.
#### Problem Domain Logic / Business Logic
Provides rules that a program follows as it processes data.
#### Key Algorithms
Performance requirements can dictate the choice of algorithms and data structures. These choices should be evaluated to predict potential vulnerabilities.
### Abstraction and Decomposition
Abstraction = method for reducing the complexity of a system to make it more manageable.
